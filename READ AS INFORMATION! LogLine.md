# LogLine

## What is LogLine?

LogLine is an **immutable event ledger** and **contract system** that forms the backbone of TrinityDB's architecture. It's based on the principle that all system state changes should be:

1. **Immutable**: Once written, spans cannot be altered
2. **Ordered**: Spans form a strict sequence
3. **Self-contained**: Each span contains all necessary context
4. **Executable**: Spans trigger contract execution

## LogLine Grammar

A LogLine system consists of:

### 1. Spans
The fundamental unit of work, represented as JSON objects:
```json
{
  "type": "namespace/action",  // Contract identifier
  "span_id": "unique_id",     // Unique identifier
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",     // When the span was created
  "parent_id": "parent_span", // Optional parent span
  "data": {}                 // Payload
}
2. Contracts
Define the behavior for specific span types:

json
{
  "contract": "namespace/action",  // Matches span.type
  "version": "1.0.0",            // Contract version
  "description": "What this contract does",
  "input_schema": {              // JSON Schema for validation
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "field": {"type": "string"}
    }
  },
  "exec": {                      // Execution instructions
    "command": "jq '.data | ...'", // Shell command
    "timeout": 5                 // Optional timeout in seconds
  }
}
3. Runtime
Loads contracts from contracts/ directory
Processes spans from spans/logline.main.jsonl
Maintains derived state in memory
Executes contract commands in isolated environments
Historical Context
LogLine evolved from several key concepts:

Event Sourcing: All changes are stored as a sequence of events
Immutable Ledger: Inspired by blockchain's append-only logs
Unix Philosophy: Small, focused tools that do one thing well
Contract-First: Declarative specifications before implementation

'll help enhance the README with more technical details and examples. Here's the expanded section:

Advanced LogLine Concepts
1. Contract Execution Model
LogLine contracts execute in an isolated environment with these characteristics:

javascript
// Example: Contract execution flow
1. Span Received → 2. Contract Lookup → 3. Input Validation → 
4. Command Execution → 5. State Update → 6. Result Emission
2. State Management
State is derived by reducing spans:

typescript
interface State {
  // Current system state
  entities: Map<EntityId, Entity>;
  
  // Indexes for fast lookups
  indexes: {
    byType: Map<string, EntityId[]>;
    byTimestamp: SortedMap<Date, EntityId>;
  };
  
  // Derived data
  statistics: {
    spansProcessed: number;
    lastUpdated: Date;
  };
}
3. Guardian System
The Guardian system ensures system health through specialized contracts:

json
{
  "contract": "guardian/health_check",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Periodic system health check",
  "schedule": "*/5 * * * *",  // Every 5 minutes
  "exec": {
    "command": "check_health.sh",
    "timeout": 30,
    "retry": {
      "attempts": 3,
      "backoff": "exponential"
    }
  }
}
4. Common Patterns
4.1. Event Sourcing
typescript
// Rebuilding state from spans
const state = spans.reduce((acc, span) => {
  return applySpan(acc, span);
}, initialState);
4.2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
json
// Command
{
  "type": "user/create",
  "data": {"name": "Alice", "role": "admin"}
}

// Query
{
  "type": "user/query",
  "data": {"filter": "role='admin'"}
}
5. Error Handling
Contracts can define error handling strategies:

json
{
  "error_handling": {
    "retry_policy": {
      "max_attempts": 3,
      "backoff": "exponential",
      "max_delay": "1m"
    },
    "fallback": {
      "command": "handle_error.sh",
      "timeout": "10s"
    }
  }
}
6. Performance Considerations
Bulk Operations:
json
{
  "type": "batch/process",
  "data": {
    "operations": [...],
    "batch_size": 100
  }
}
Indexing Strategy:
typescript
// Indexes are automatically maintained
interface Indexes {
  byType: Map<string, Span[]>;
  byTimestamp: SortedMap<Date, Span>;
  custom: Map<string, Map<string, Span[]>>;
}
7. Security Model
Authentication:
json
{
  "type": "auth/token",
  "data": {
    "permissions": ["read:documents", "write:profile"]
  }
}
Authorization:
typescript
function authorize(span: Span, user: User): boolean {
  return user.permissions.some(p => 
    span.type.startsWith(p.split(':')[0])
  );
}
8. Monitoring and Observability
Built-in monitoring through special span types:

json
{
  "type": "metrics/collect",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "2025-06-25T01:33:25Z",
    "metrics": {
      "spans_processed": 1500,
      "avg_processing_time_ms": 45.7,
      "memory_usage_mb": 256.8
    }
  }
}
9. Example: Complete User Registration Flow
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as API
    participant L as LogLine
    participant G as Guardian

    C->>A: POST /register {email, password}
    A->>L: Create span: user/register
    L->>L: Validate contract
    L->>L: Execute registration
    L->>G: Emit user/registered
    G->>G: Trigger welcome email
    G->>G: Update metrics
    A-->>C: 201 Created {userId}
10. Best Practices
Idempotency:
json
{
  "type": "user/update",
  "span_id": "unique_request_id",
  "data": {"email": "new@example.com"}
}
Schema Evolution:
json
{
  "contract": "user/create",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "compatibility": ["1.0.0"],
  "migrations": [
    {
      "from": "1.0.0",
      "script": "migrate_1.0.0_to_1.1.0.sh"
    }
  ]
}
